      "7.1  Background \n",
      "Malaria is a common and life-threatening disease in  many tropical and subtropical areas. There \n",
      "is currently a risk of malaria transmission in 91 c ountries and  territories, and these are visited \n",
      "by more than 125 million international travellers e very  year. \n",
      "Each year many international travellers fall ill wi th malaria while visiting countries/territories \n",
      "where malaria is endemic, and well  over 10 000 are reported to become ill with malaria  after \n",
      "returning home. However, under-reporting means that  the real figure may  be considerably \n",
      "higher. International travellers to countries/terri tories with ongoing local malaria transmission \n",
      "arriving from  countries with no transmission are at high risk of malaria infection and its \n",
      "consequences because they lack immunity. Migrants  from countries/territories with malaria \n",
      "transmission living in malaria-free countries and r eturning to their home countries to visit  \n",
      "friends and relatives are similarly at risk because  of waning or absent immunity. \n",
      "Travellers who fall ill during travel may find it d ifficult to access reliable medical care. \n",
      "Those who develop malaria upon  returning to a country that is malaria-free face pa rticular \n",
      "problems: medical personnel may be unfamiliar with malaria, the  diagnosis may be delayed, \n",
      "and effective antimalarial medicines may not be reg istered and/or available, resulting in \n",
      "progression to  severe malaria with complications and, consequently , high case  fatality rates.  \n",
      "Fever occurring in a traveller within 3 months of l eaving a country in which there is risk \n",
      "of malaria is a potential medical  emergency and should be investigated urgently to \n",
      "exclude malaria. In the rare situations in which there is no rapid a ccess to reliable \n",
      "diagnostic  facilities, standby emergency treatment (SBET) is i ndicated (see section 7.3.2). \n",
      " \n",
      "7.1.1  Cause  \n",
      "Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasite Plasmod ium. Human malaria is caused by five \n",
      "different species of Plasmodium: P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax and P.knowlesi . \n",
      "Of these, P. falciparum and  P. vivax are the most prevalent, and P. falciparum  is the most \n",
      "dangerous, with the highest rates of complications and mortality. This deadly form of malaria is \n",
      "a serious public health concern in most countries i n sub-Saharan Africa. P.  knowlesi, a species \n",
      "that normally infects animals, can  occasionally infect humans. As yet there are no rep orts of \n",
      "human-mosquito-human transmission of such “zoonotic ” forms of malaria. \n",
      " \n",
      "7.1.2 Transmission  \n",
      "The malaria parasite is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes, which bite mainly between \n",
      "dusk and dawn.\n"
